# arken/packages/cli/ANALYSIS.md

## Snapshot (2026-02-18)
- Target role: executable CLI wrapper over Arken routers/modules.
- Current local test gate status is blocked in this checkout/runtime:
  - `rushx test` fails because Rush workspace expects missing package `@arken/cerebro-hub`.
  - `npm test` fails because local `vitest` binary is unavailable.

## Safe next step
- Restore a runnable repo-defined test command in this checkout (either Rush workspace integrity or local dependency install).
- After test command is runnable, proceed with source-level reliability fixes and validate with passing test output in the same run.

## 2026-02-18 late-night slot-12 verification
- Re-ran branch hygiene (`git fetch origin` + merge `origin/main`) and loaded local markdown before source review (`README.md`, this file).
- Deepest-first source skim prioritized `test/*` and module routers/CLIs (`modules/*/*.cli.ts`, `router.ts`, `trpc-compat.ts`).
- Current test commands in this checkout:
  - `npm test -- --runInBand` ❌ `vitest: command not found`
  - `rushx test` ❌ Rush workspace package-map drift (`@arken/cerebro-hub` expected at `arken/cerebro/hub/package.json`).
- No source edits were made under the source-change test gate.
