# arken/packages/cli/ANALYSIS.md

## Snapshot (2026-02-18)
- Target role: executable CLI wrapper over Arken routers/modules.
- Current local test gate status is blocked in this checkout/runtime:
  - `rushx test` fails because Rush workspace expects missing package `@arken/cerebro-hub`.
  - `npm test` fails because local `vitest` binary is unavailable.

## Safe next step
- Restore a runnable repo-defined test command in this checkout (either Rush workspace integrity or local dependency install).
- After test command is runnable, proceed with source-level reliability fixes and validate with passing test output in the same run.
